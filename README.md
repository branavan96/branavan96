## Summary
I am a BSc Mathematics graduate from Brunel University, who is currently looking for roles in Data Science. You can have a look at the projects that I have done at the HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp.

As well as this, I have good conversational language skills in French. As well as this I can work well in a team and use Microsoft Office.

By working well in a team, I make sure that everyone is getting on with the task and it is done when the deadline is set, which is also demonstrates my effective leadership skills. For my second year project for Statistics at university, I was using different Excel functions and R Studio to analyse a large data set.
